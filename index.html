                I began my educational journey at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Chennai, where I completed my primary education up to Class 10. This experience not only instilled in me a sense of academic rigor but also a deep appreciation for cultural exchange and adaptation. 📚

                Having grown up in a family with a defense background, I am imbued with values of discipline, resilience, and patriotism. My father's service has inspired me to embrace challenges with determination and a commitment to excellence. 🇮🇳
